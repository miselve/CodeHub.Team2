# Code.Hub Team2 Cloud Engeneering
This is our final project deliverable to conclude our Seminar on Cloud Engeneering by Code.Hub

## Project Objective
This project's main objective was to provide us with hands-on experience while working with Azure Cloud Services. 
The scenario was to design and implement a cloud infrastructure on Microsoft Azure for a fictional software company, MultiSoftware Enterprise, transitioning from an outdated on-premises architecture. The cloud solution aims to:

1. Establish secure, multi-factor authentication and access control for internal and external services.
2. Host company websites, APIs, and databases, supporting user access and data integrity.
3. Implement serverless operations for stateless workloads.
4. Ensure scalable storage and compliant data retention for large volumes of public and private content.
5. Provide detailed resource billing insights to separate costs for internal operations.
6. The outcome includes creating detailed architecture diagrams, deployment scripts, cost analysis, and a presentation of the projectâ€™s implementation and management aspects.

## Infrastructure Design 
Here is the designed diagram, showing the services we decided to use

## Justification for Service Selections
**1. Azure Entra ID**

  * Provides authentication with Office 365 and supports multi-factor authentication (2FA) to secure user access.

**2. Web Application Firewall (WAF)**

  * Ensures a secure endpoint at the network edge.
  * Protects against unwanted external access and enhances network security.

**3. Azure App Service**

  * We chose the `Premium P0V3` instance, which we estimate will sufficiently meet our production environment needs.

**4. Azure Functions**

  * Offers serverless capabilities to streamline stateless operations.

**5. Virtual Network**

  * Internal network designed to protect and isolate specific resources.
  * Database, Blob Storage, and Archive Storage are connected within this Virtual Network and are accessible only by App Services and Functions.

**6. Database**

  * Using a PostgreSQL flexible server `(D2sV3, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)` for familiarity with PostgreSQL and expected workload suitability.

**7. Blob Storage**

  * Stores multimedia files accessible via the website.
  * `Hot Storage` tier selected to ensure high availability for frequently accessed files.
8. Archive Storage

  * `Cold storage` chosen to retain company logs that are infrequently accessed.
  * Files older than one day are automatically archived for cost efficiency.
